## Project architecture

The project is written in accordance with [FSD (Feature sliced design)](https://feature-sliced.design/ru/docs/get-started/overview)

----

## Working with translations

The project uses the [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) library to work with translations.
Translation files are stored in public/locales.

For comfortable work, we recommend installing the plugin for webstorm/vscode **I18nSupport**.

----

## Tests

The project uses 4 types of tests:
1) Regular unit tests on jest - `npm run test:unit`
2) Component tests with React testing library -`npm run test:unit`
3) Screenshot testing with loki `npm run test:ui`
4) e2e testing with Cypress `npm run test:e2e`

[Read more about tests](/docs/tests.md)

----

## Linting

The project uses eslint to check typescript code and stylelint to check style files.

Also for strict control of the main architectural principles it uses own eslint plugin [**eslint-plugin-fsd-checker**](https://github.com/sashtje/eslint-plugin-fsd-checker),
which consists 3 rules:
1) **path-checker** - prohibits the use of absolute imports within one module;
2) **public-api-imports** - allows import from other modules only from public api. Has auto fix;
3) **layer-imports** - checks the correct use of layers in terms of FSD (import from overlying layers cannot be used in underlying layers);

----

## Running linters

- `npm run lint:ts` - Running eslint on .ts and .tsx files
- `npm run lint:ts:fix` - Running eslint fix on .ts and .tsx files
- `npm run lint:scss` - Running stylelint on style files
- `npm run lint:scss:fix` - Running stylelint fix on style files Ð»Ð¸Ð½Ñ‚ÐµÑ€Ð¾Ð¼

----

## Storybook

The project describes story cases for each component.
Requests to the server are mocked using storybook-addon-mock.

A file with story cases is created next to the component with the extension .stories.tsx

The storybook can be running with the command:
- `npm run storybook`

[Read more about Storybook](/docs/storybook.md)

----

## Project configuration

For development, the project contains 2 configs:
1. `Webpack` - ./config/build
2. `vite` - vite.config.ts

Both builders are adapted to the main features of the application.

All configuration of webpack is stored in /config
- /config/babel - babel
- /config/build - configuration of webpack
- /config/jest - configuration of tests
- /config/storybook - configuration of storybook

The folder `scripts` contains various scripts for refactoring and report generation.

----

## CI pipeline and pre commit hooks

The Github actions configuration is in /.github/workflows.
All types of tests, project building and storybook assembly, and linting are run in ci.

In precommit hooks we check the project with linters, config is located in /.husky

----

## Working with data

Interaction with data is carried out using the **Redux Toolkit**.
If possible, reused entities should be normalized using EntityAdapter

Requests to the server are sent using [**RTK query**](/src/shared/api/rtkApi.ts)

For asynchronous connection of reducers (so as not to pull them into a common bundle) it is used
[**DynamicModuleLoader**](/src/shared/lib/components/DynamicModuleLoader/DynamicModuleLoader.tsx)

----

## Working with data

Use of features is allowed only with the helper "toggleFeatures". It accepts an object with options:

```javascript
{
  name: string; // feature flag name
    on: () => T; // a function that will work after enabling the feature
    off: () => T; // a function that will work after disabling the feature
}
```

To automatically remove a feature, use  `scripts/remove-feature.ts` in the following format:
`ts-node scripts/remove-feature.ts feature-name feature-state`

Feature state can take only one of two values: **on** or **off**.
